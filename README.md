# Optimization-modeling-project-using-Excel-Solver
In this project, a transshipment optimization model for the smartphone supply chain is built using Excel solver where three types of goods are transported from three factories to five retailers with four warehouses playing the role of intermediaries. In the model, the decision variables are the quantities of all three products being transported via are different routes. Moreover, there are three main types of transporting route including routes from factories to warehouses, factories to retailers and warehouses to retailers. The purpose of this model is to minimize the cost of delivering products from factories to retailers by determining the decision variables which are optimal numbers of goods allocated to each of the transportation routes. Figure 1 explains the components of the equations which will be given in the next part.
